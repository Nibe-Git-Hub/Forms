-Tweet Posting: Users can post short text messages (tweets).

-Image Uploads: Attach images to tweets.

-Basic Feed: Displays recent tweets.

-Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly interface.

Prerequisites 
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8+: Download Python

pip: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

Git: Download Git

Getting Started 
Follow these steps to get your Django project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository 
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project:

git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of your repository
cd Forms

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment 
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. This keeps your project isolated from other Python projects.

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies 
With your virtual environment activated, install all the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Apply Database Migrations 
Django uses migrations to define and evolve your database schema.

python manage.py makemigrations Accounts Tweets
python manage.py migrate

5. Create a Superuser (Optional but Recommended) 
To access the Django admin panel and manage users/tweets, create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser

Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.

6. Run the Development Server 
Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

You can now access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

How to Use 
Registering an Account 
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/Accounts/register/ or click the "Register" link on the homepage.

Fill in your desired username and password.

Username Filtering: Try to use shit, fuck, or bobo (case-insensitive) in your username. The form validation will prevent you from registering with these words.

Submit the form. If registration is successful, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the "Post a Tweet" page.

Posting a Tweet with an Image 
Ensure you are logged in. If not, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/Accounts/login/ and log in with your registered account.

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/Tweets/post/ or click the "Post Tweet" link.

Enter your tweet content in the text area.

Click "Choose File" to select an image from your computer to attach to your tweet (optional).

Click the "Tweet" button to post your tweet.

Your tweet will appear on the same page under "Recent Tweets" and also on the home page (http://127.00.1:8000/).
